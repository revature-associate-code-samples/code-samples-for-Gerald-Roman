# Movie Fanatic
MovieFanatic is a dynamic web application with an intuitive user interface that allows both guests and logged in members to the website to view a featured movie, the most popular movies, best reviewed movies of the year, comedies and dramas all on the home page. When a movie is selected, the user is brought to the movie view, where everything from the director, producers, and cast to the tag line, imdb and rotten tomatoes scores, plot summary and more is available to see. Click on a director, actor or producer in the movie view, and you are taken to a different view, where you can see an actor or directorâ€™s profile image, birthdate, popularity, and biography. Below there is also a display showing the movies that the actor or director has appeared in. Throughout the application, there is a search bar near the top of the page where users can search for any movie by title, as well as actors and directors by name. Once logged in, additional features are available to the user such as rating a movie, adding a movie to a favorite list and adding reviews for each movie.
