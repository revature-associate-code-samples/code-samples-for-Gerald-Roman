# Project 0: Java CLI Banking Application
This application allows users to create a bank account and interact with that account through the command line. Users are able to deposit, withdraw, and check funds in their account. The application includes validation for usernames, emails, and more. Users are able to log in to and out of their accounts, maintaining session state via file IO and the singleton design pattern.
